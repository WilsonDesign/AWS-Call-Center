Thank you for taking the time to view my Amazon Connect Call Center. 

In this project I have created a Amazon Connect Call Center that calls different Lambda functions that pull the current weather temperature for four different locations.

This project is currently setup to just pull the temperture data, however I have created the API to be able to pull multiple different weather statistics for each location as requested.

You can access this live project by calling this number and connecting to the Amazon Connect Call Center today. +1 833-344-3940

Thank you for visiting my Call Center and enjoy the weather out there!
